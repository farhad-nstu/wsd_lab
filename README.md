# Task is develop a user managment module.

I have done this using Laravel framework. 

To visit this site please download it from github. And then run it on your local server. First install composer and setup a database. Then run php artisan migrate --seed commnad. By doing this web guard for user and admin, role, permission and some dummy data will be created.
